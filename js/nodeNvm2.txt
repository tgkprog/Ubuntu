nvm node version manager keeps differnt versions of node and npm at ~/.nvm/versions/ like ~/.nvm/versions/node/v14.15.0/bin
Here ~ is home folder 

 nvm install --lts

nvm use --lts

nvm --help

#after that can use npm and node
#sudo not required
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli

npm cache verify 

npm install -g @angular/cli


You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)
You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT  to serve your project on a new port

My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)
Check if the window running ng serve  displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI
